# Energy-Consumption-Model
Classification model of the energy consumption with the data collected from a smart small-scale steel industry in South Korea.<br> 
I took the data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.<br>

A steel company has a few challenges apart from market competition like Increased energy Costs, downtime, inefficient resource allocation, maintenance, and regulatory compliance <br>
Problems: If the company does not know which conditions lead to high energy consumption and which ones lead to low and medium energy loads, those challenges will become serious problems- <br>
